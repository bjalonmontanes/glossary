headword: IaaS
expansion: Infrastructure as a Service
definition: >
  Managing the physical computer hardware necessary to run workloads is a costly and difficult business. As a result, 
  many companies prefer to outsource this responsibility to other companies with the expertise and scale needed to manage 
  infrastructure well. IaaS customers pay metered rates for each virtual machine, disk, network, or other cloud resource 
  they consume. Example IaaS providers include Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services.
