headword: ISV
expansion: Independent Software Vendor
definition: >
  An independent software vendor (ISV) is an organization specializing in making and selling software.
  In our context, this usually refers to a company building, or providing commercial support for, a
  software product adjacent to Cloud Foundry that customer applications may depend on. Examples of
  such products include databases, application performance monitoring (APM) products, and API gateways.
  We partner with many of these ISVs to help them integrate their products with Pivotal Cloud Foundry,
  typically resulting in a partner tile on Pivotal Network (PivNet).
