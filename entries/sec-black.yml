definition: >
 One of the three color designations for Pivotal security incidents. If a particular task is designated sec-black, it means that the task needs to interrupt current work and the team is expected to work after hours (within reason) until the task is finished. A sec-black for a CF team can only be called by a CF VP or higher.
